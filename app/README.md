I will create fitness/workout tracking app.

Must have features:
- Must track movement of user
- Must track how long the workout goes for
- Must track the location of the user to calculate distance
- Must allow for user to log in or create an account
- User data must be stored on Firebase
- Must have users to access a workout routine after watching an ad

  Nice to have features:
- Could have the user follow friends on the app to compare their workouts
- Could have an option to pay to not have ads
- Could have an option to create a custom workout routine with “premium” version
